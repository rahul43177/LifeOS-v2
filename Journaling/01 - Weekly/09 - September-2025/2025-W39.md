Monday : 22 sept  - Sunday : 28 sept

22 Sept : Monday was a bit difficult as it I just came home from an accident and we went to doctors and got me checked up and x-ray and stuff

23 Sept : It was good , we went for shopping for muski , we hopped so many stores for trekking shoes , wind chitter , rain-coat and chhoti chhoti chize 

24 Sept : It was little sad , I cried when she left in the train , I felt so heavy and sad , I felt like a baby . But I am so excited also for her.
