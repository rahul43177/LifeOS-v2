## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 01:17 am
- So I have yoga in the morning 
- So we feel unease and we are not able to reclaim our energy because we are not able to close the loop (close the unfinished) work. 
- [[../../../Z-Personal Learning/03 - Productivity Patterns/01 - Zeigarnik Effect|Zeigarnik Effect]] - Which means waiters - they remember the unpaid orders better than the paid ones. 
- So similarly we keep the brain engaged more in the things which are not done . We can reclaim that energy by doing the tasks.
###### 09:50 am
- I went for the Yoga class , the entire class was like **Meditation**
- It was such a disconnect from this world. 
- We did a practice of dancing and moving into a trance-state.

###### 11:54 am 
- So the class is going on , but I am in some thoughts , I am not able to focus on the class
- I am just lost in my thoughts and this Yoga class has made me feel so peaceful , it is all Yin Yang now 
- Now I am feeling like I don't want anything in this material world 
- What is the point of earning and grinding all my life , where the whole point of the life should be just enjoy and experience. 
- So I just lost the calling for grinding and studying hard and motivation all together. 
- Even I want to just be still , just like a untouched water. 
- But even that Yoga and Martial arts class is paid , everything boils down at the end to the **Money**
