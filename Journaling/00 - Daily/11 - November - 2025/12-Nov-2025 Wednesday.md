## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 07:32 pm #relieved  #relax #productive 
- So right now I am feeling really really good because I completed the frontend implementation 
- I tested it as well , but there are some dependencies I have which are from backend side which Sujan is doing. 
- He is really smart and honest , I like his attitude. I did not feel like working and hence I missed out on few things , "mera hi galti hai , abhi kal tak fix karta hu"
###### Overall #important #joy #proud 
- I had a chat with Sudheer where I am able to mention about my skills 
- Had little talk in general about the life and all 
- Told him how I am contributing to both frontend and backend
- Then later connected with Hari and catch up with him 
- Later that day I connected with Surya who wants me in CNA screen and how I would be contributing in something so important 
- It felt really good to be relevant in the office and people wanting you to work with you 
- It was such a nice day 
- After coming to my Vishesh place as I did not want to commute back to home 
- I stayed there in Vishesh bhaiya’s place and on discord , me and muskan spent time together and played chess which was so relaxing and fun 
- So I didn’t commute + good productive day at work + chilled after work as we played chess ♟️.
- It was a really good day — I was really really happy the entire day.
