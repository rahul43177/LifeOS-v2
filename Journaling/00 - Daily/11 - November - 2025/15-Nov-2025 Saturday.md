## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 12:33 am #productive 
- Doing the assignment and studies , right now feeling really really good and looking forward for more assignments from the AirTribe cohort. 
- Right now it is easy peasy -- CRUD Operations RESTAPIs so I am able to do it easily. 
- Let's see how it goes in the future. I hope I continue this habit of attending class and doing the assignment. 


###### 12:10 pm
- Just went out from the bed , feeling really refreshed and rested 

###### 01:10 pm
- Right now I am connecting with Kunal and we are just discussing about JavaScript , as he is learning JS 
- So I am testing him on it with simple examples like -- write a program to find out weather a person is pass or fail. 

###### 03:47 PM
- I feel so lethargic today as I overslept
- And I ate the food

###### 09:03 PM
- Came for a engagement party for some father’s section friend
- Watching people getting left and right — is little overwhelming to put myself into that position 
- But I want to get engaged as well.
- But i feel little nervous as well , but this feels good
- I can see how happy and relieved they are getting engaged, I can see their faces 
- It’s like “we did it finally”
- Kitne problems aye honge 
- Kitne logo ne oppose kiya hoga
- Kitne baar toh ye dono ne khud doubt kiya hoga ki — is this the right partner for me or not 
- And here they are after the struggle

## Reflection of the day
(If you have time or feel like writing more.)

==What helped me feel slightly better today?==
- Sleeping till late and giving my body rest

==One thing I'm grateful for:==
- To have safe space 
	- house or home feels like a safe space to be in — kitna bhi bura din ho apne ghar pe aao , apne room pe leto — sab thik ho jayega socho aur sojao . safe space
	- A good girl — I feel so good and safe around her , and that leads me to share everything whatever I am going through — She understands the situation and guides me with some suggestions and advices , Safe space.
