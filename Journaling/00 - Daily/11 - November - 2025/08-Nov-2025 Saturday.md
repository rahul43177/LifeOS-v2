## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day

###### 01:47 AM
- Muskan wanted me to realize that it is not cool to call people "MOTA"
- So we had a little diffferent tangent wala arguement , so I told mai tere sath nahi karunga abse mote wale jokes , which are not good but I did it 
- And then she just stops telling me anything and giving me love all of a sudden , and that is freedom.

###### 12:25 pm
- These DSA classes are not fruitful , They are just rushing to it 
- 2 ghante me sliding windows bhi karwa diya , 2 pointers bhi karwa diya and then questions bhi karwa diye
- And right after next class - ab ye log recursion and medium level questions karwa rahe hai 
- So THIS is just rushing and want to complete it soon , kehne ke liye karwa rahe hai 

###### 01:00 pm
- I will complete the Array and Recursion in this weekend 
- I will try to complete the roadmap studies whatever is left for me

- Need to plan about it 
- Let's complete the arrays and the recursion today pure din baith ke 
- Let's complete the JS fundamentals at night
