## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 01:00 am #anxiety 
- Going to sleep , But I am feeling a sense of anxiousness , I am not able to understand the source of it. 
- I don't know where is it coming from , one possible reason could be Monday is here and then I had a deadline to deliver a feature , and some part of it is still left.

###### In general what I am feeling from some days #furious #anger #shattered #alone #heavyHeart
 - I got the feeling that Muskan is not feeling good because of the incident of that Aunty acting awkward and so obvious 
- It was funny and I told it in that way only
- Everyone took it as funny only 
- I know it feels bad considering how possessive she is.
- But directly jumping to the conclusion and with the sure shot assumption with saying things like : 
	- “Mujhe pata hai tune maze kiye hai uske sath” and all 
	- You loved it today!
	- No wonder I wasn't feeling good at all
	- I don't wanna take this anymore
	- No way you are the one for me 
Go away
- The above are the exact words , pasted it here 
- What did I do , I just shared one incident happened where my mother , father and brother all were there 
- And we just laughed it off , as it was funny 
- what did I do to hear , I am not the one and as if I did something which is hurting her.
- These things are affecting me a lot.
- I don’t get much love , I am mostly always looked with the eyes of constant suspicion.
- Always questioning be and doubting.
- All the time.
- I have done some terrible shit in the past I understand but if I did wrong , I changed as well.
- I promised to change and I did change , I am not in contact with anyone , no girls , no boys other than Anshul and Ayush 
- But still she got so traumatised, that is my fault but now I ask myself mai aur kya karu ? 
	- I realised my mistake 
	- Apologised to her 
	- Worked on that mistake and never repeated again.
	- I am literally not in contact with anyone or doing anything which is wrong.
- I think this is what I can do 
- pata hai mujhe ki ye bare minimum hai but what else more can I do ?  Iske baad bhi I get to constantly looked by the eyes of suspicion 
- additionally this trauma se she gets bad dream about me because most of the time at night and all she thinks bad about me either she is scared of me doing something and then usko bure sapne ate hai 
- Fir uske liye vo feelings re live ho jati hai 
- Fir vo mujhse kafa rehti hai aur acche se baat nahi karti 
- In my views I feel like what happened suddenly and aise kyu behave kar rahi hai ye and that triggers me a lot and then she goes like I saw a bad dream about you , tu abhi bhi kuch kar raha hai na . And for no reason very often I gets treated like shit 
- No i love yous from her
- No pyaar and nothing 
- Acting all cold 
- Sometimes it goes till gaali and all as well 
- these things take toll on my mental and if I try to take some time off and go away to be alone and i dont pick phone 
- She starts to threaten , either you pick up the call or I am calling your mom 
- What is this yaar
- So toxic , I hate it
- Bas exist kar rahe hai sath me types
--- 
- Ab mai kya karu ? 
- Mujhe aise partner ke sath acha nahi lagta 
- Apne convenience ke hisaab se pyaar karti hai 
- Jab mood acha hai toh duniya bhar ka pyaar 
- Otherwise I don’t even exist for her and the reason is very nil and void for me
- Maine abhi toh kuch nahi kiya na, i understand you saw a dream but vo sach thodi hai 
- Agar mai mana karu toh bolti hai mere sare dreams sach hote hai and mind your mouth 
- But mujh toh samne hi dikh rahe hai sab galat hote hue because I am not doing anything neither I am talking to anyone 
- Synchronicities bhi galat hote hue dikh rahe hai 
- fir vo bolti hai , tu mere synchronicities ko galat mat bol 
- Toh what am I supposed to do ? Accept karu jo chiz sach hai hi nahi 
- Mai sach me kuch kar hi nahi raha hu and tumhare synchronicity and dreams galat ho rahe hai , toh mai is situation me kya karu 
- Mera bhi ek tolerance hai fir mujhe bhi gussa ata hai 
- Agar gussa karo toh bolti hai tujhe sambhalna nahi ata 
- Agar mai pyaar se koshish karu handle karne ki toh bolti hai manipulate kar raha hai 
- Karu kya yaar mai ? :( 
- samajh bhi nahi aa raha hai because I love her so much 
- Chordna bhi nahi hai aur raha bhi nahi ja raha hai aise marr marr ke 

Mujhe samajh hi nahi aa rah hai kya karu
