## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 12:34 am
- Today is Raunak's birthday and we celebrated with mom's home made cake , it was nice and tasty 
- Subah office bhi jana hai and then martial arts class bhi hai , so let's see I should be sleeping now. otherwise my sleep schedule will be same like how it was last week.
- Monday full sleep and then collapsing , so let me wind down , If I go to bed now I will sleep in 30 mins. 
######  09:30 AM #worried
- Going to office , I am worried about my finance , I feel like I should handle it well 
- Otherwise no matter how much money I have , it will be gone away 
- First thing I should start is recording my expenses and find the pattern where my most of money is going and how to cut it down 
- I should also increase the SIPs and investments for my future
- Right now I skip a lot of SIPs because I waste a lot of money and then credit card bill comes so I skip the SIP to have money to pay credit care bill. 
- I should be sincere about my finance otherwise I will not have anything in corpus and savings 
- Let’s take it serious from next month and I will save crazy amount of money .

###### 12:04 pm
- I have reached the office and feeling little calm and there is nothing I am feeling right now , right now I am blank and calm 
- Let's get started with the planning and then execution of the plan 
- So that I can close the tickets -- I have to leave the office early as well , as today is my brother's birthday. 
- So will plan according to that. 
###### 10:58 pm 
- Today because of Raunak's birthday it was good , we celebrated and enjoyed the day.
- We cut the cake and went out for dinner out. 
- And it was good I sent 5k rs to Raunak as a token of gift on his birthday. 

###### Overall
- It was good day , in the office also it was chill
- It was good in the home also 
- But one thing which troubled me a lot is troublesome nature of Muskan Father's behaviour -- how he always tries to assert dominance and try to put the other person down. 
- This is not at all cool -- today he broke and dressing table fenk diya and the mirror in the dressing table broke and scattered which is really really dangerous 
- How am I supposed be chill and be happy when my partner is going through with all this in the family where father is abusive and toxic. 
- Who's ego is so big that he does not even care about his daughter's life and trying to hurt her. 
- This is so saddening and even I don't know how to help her in this situation as this is very personal family problem.
- Other than that , there is small tension which is building in back of my mind is -- That I am worried about my cohort -- I just neglecting it -- today was my brother's birthday celebration so I left the class . But still I have so much spillover left to clean and complete. It is minute thing which there in my mind to focus more on studies.
