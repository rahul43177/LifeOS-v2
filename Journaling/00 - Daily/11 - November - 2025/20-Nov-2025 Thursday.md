## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 11:30 am #calm
- Today I slept so much - I did not go for the martial arts class 
- nor the office -- will be working from home , but still I will have my energies recharged , so it is fine. 

###### 04:00 pm #angry #irritated 
- So my mom went for the party with her friends in the morning , Muskan around 12:50 pm I called her to wake her up -- where she was meditating 
- She asked me what are you doing -- I told her and then directly -> Ghar wale  ? 
- This thing got me so so irritated -- Hamesha wahi sab ki ghar pe akela toh nahi hai and all. 
- So to make it clear ki mat puchha kar baar baar -- I told ghar wale kaha honge ghar pe hi honge na -> But my mom went for the party right now and papa is here. 
- And now this is called lying to her , and now I talked to her -- where something really affected me so much which was mostly - 
	- Jaldi jaldi kaam complete karle aur aja mere paas -- hamesha this statement triggers me a lot -- mera dimaag hi ghum jata hai hamesha 
	- It feels like someone else is planning my day for me -- abhi ye karle , fir ye karle -- according to their convinience and then my brain starts to think -- kitna selfish hai vo insaan , right now this was not the case . Because I was just thinking about it -- and Muskan starts kya hua tujhe -- that time even I don't know mai bhi process kar raha hu -- 
- So abhi bhi wahi gussa hogayi -- ki tu rehne de , bana le mann ke kahani and then mujhe jhoot jhoot bata dena -- jaise subah bhi bol raha tha 
- If I don't know what happened to me -- i need time bolne pe tujhko gussa aa raha hai bhai toh rehlo gussa -- not cool 
- and morning me jhoot vo tab hota jab mai usko chhupata
- But is chiz pe chid ke phone cut karna and mera aur bhi mood upset aur khud ka bhi. 
- Hamesha mujhe jhoota bolte rehti hai , bas yahi hai har kuch din me ye sab nahi hua toh maza nahi ata isko 
- Writing everything whatever I am feeling right now --- I feel so so pissed and irritated.
- Fir pyaara kitna bhi ban jaao ye sab jo emotions and ye jo feel karwaya hai uska kya. 
- Chordo so jata hu thodi der -- going for a nap at 04:18 pm -- 

###### 09:45 pm
- I went for running -- I ran for the 5 km after so long -- to build a habit of running 
- As daily my feed is filled with the post from people posting their strava and running a marathon and then David Goggins. 
- So I also got excited and ran today -- it was not super good , I ran then walk for sometime then ran and then walked for sometime 
- But overall felt really really nice -- it was a good running session will try to continue it. 
- Mostly I plan to go to Martial Arts Practice session by running there. 
- THen I watched the video which Muskan edited for Grand Master -- Wow it is 10 on 10 -- perfect , Starting from 
	- Transition 
	- Voice over 
	- Video effects 
	- Story telling 
	- Music alignment 
	- Text for reference in the video 
- Everything is 10 on 10

## What is my mind saying?
(Write the thoughts that are repeating — even small ones.)
- The thing which is coming in my mind is that -- I should also start creating the content.
- I don't what category , what genre , I don't even know what topic to make video on.
- Mostly about the things I do in a more cinematic way. 
- I don't or some voice over of me and things happening in my life in the video, I am not sure 
- But I genuinely feel that I can be a great content creator , even a funny creator as well on Instagram for short form content , not sure about the long form content , but there is also shorts section on the YouTube , something could be done.
- Cinematic videos , some quotes or talk videos , funny videos , vlogs saying -- things I do -- run , code , learn daily , commute , work in learn Marital Arts , Yoga over the weekends , badminton with friends , party with them , ride a GT 650 bike , wear decent clothes , play games -- like jack of all trades. 
- I don't know I am thinking of these things like which one and how to start -- if I get one head start I can be a big thing I know that  , because I have that potential in me , and now watching master's video and other youtube video I feel like I can also do these things.
