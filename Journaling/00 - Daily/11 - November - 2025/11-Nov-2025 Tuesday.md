###### 01:50 AM #tired
- going to sleep 
- i hope i wake up and go for martial arts practice
- Because it’s already too late
###### 08:59 AM #productive #good 
- Just came from practice 
- It was good 
- Post practice we meditated for a while and post meditation I always feel little low and down and I don't feel like talking to anyone 
- Maybe that is because I take some time to get out of the zone. 
- But overall it was good

###### 09:30 am #excited 
- I took a leave today as I was not feeling good and I was not in the mood to work today. 
- So I just applied the leave and I plan to spent the entire day with my girlfriend Muskan 
###### 09:07 pm #rush
- We are checking out from the room , it was a wonderful day we spent together 
- It was such a relaxing day , the day was awesome 
- Had chats 
- Watched a movie 
- Cuddles and talked.
- I have a class from 9:15 pm now from the AirTribe cohort.So we are rushing and going to home 

###### 11:19 pm #hope 
- Winding down now , and let's sleep
- I will pick the things from full potential from tomorrow.
- I am not finding any interest in the office work to be very honest.
- I don't feel excited about the work , I am still trying to figure out weather it is from the kind of task they are giving me or it is just a phase which has come.

	- I don't want to be part of the layoff
2. Heavy

	- It feels heavy and I try to tell her as well , that these things are not true. 
	- But feels heavy.
