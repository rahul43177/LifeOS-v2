## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 10:30 am #motivated 
- little bit worried about the delivery for the NA 
- I didn’t raise the PR for the UAT
- There were some changes suggested for the Test env as well which are also left
- But it is fine today I am gonna crush everything related to NA and then there is a ticket for the store group download optimisation which Sahana is asking updates for every week
- At the same time I am not feeling the excitement for the work
- I want something interesting and some really good work but it’s fine.
