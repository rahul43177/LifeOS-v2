###### 1:37 pm #productive #good #satisfied
- Just done with the class and learning new things feels so good
- This feeling of studying even more after a session is unmatchable , I feel so pushed and motivated. 
- I have learnt something new and now my brain is craving for something more , I have planned my entire day in the todoist and notion calendar and now I have an outline of the day 
- I will just follow that. 
- Feeling really great this feeling of productivity.

- Everything seems good and life is good
- Made my first post on reddit in the obsidian community as a showcase of my graph saying : 2 months of note taking
