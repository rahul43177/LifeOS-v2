## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day
###### 07:58 am
- So I came from the from my Shaolin Martial Arts class
- It was all cardio and abdomen exercises today.
- Slowly Slowly I am feeling the change in my self and I am feeling strong day by day.  
- Yoga class is also there tomorrow , so looking forward to it and feeling a bit excited for that as well. 
- Right now I am feeling nothing , no stress , no joy , it is still just like water untouched 
- This is really calming for me , and it could be due to the retrospective I have done in the **Meditation** post the *class*. 
- I was able to calm the chaos in my mind of the deadlines , meetings and new feature I have to deliver today as today is the last working day of the week

###### 06:33 PM
- I went office with bike after so long
- Because I felt a trauma post that bike accident whatever happened 
- Who will come from which side
- But I feel this is a very small trauma and I feel great after coming back 
- But to be very honest , coming from bus with seat and nothing to chill , I can just chill , use phone , read something or simply sleep 
- Riding bike is so stressful and need to be attentive all the time. 

###### 10:32 pm
- Right now I am feeling little chill and relaxed as now I have two days to chill and there is nothing to look forward
- Yoga and Martial Arts Class is also not there tomorrow as Master has called off , so now I feel little chill and relaxed.

###### 10:37 pm
- These days I don't get much time
- I wake early attend the class of Martial Arts , Roam around little bit with Muskan after the class 
- Then suddenly it is the time to go to office and then rush towards office and commute for around 2.5 hours in bus  
- Then I have to work in office 
- Travel back almost 2.5 hours again 
- Then Muskan picks me up , we go to GKVK spend time together and then around 9:30 or 10 , we come back to home 
- And then my family is all over me and want to talk to me and so many questions. 
- They don't leave me for a second also , because they want to catchup what is happening in my life in that short duration of the end of the day , they want to share their stuff and what is happening in their life as well. 
- After dinner + family time , It is almost 11 or 11:30 and then there is no time for myself to recharge my batteries .
- Additionally my body also starts to ask for Rest and sleep because I woke up so early. 
- I miss sitting just with myself and spend time with myself . 
- Entertain myself , watch something youtube video alone. 
- I want to be quite for sometime. 
- It feels very heavy today , I am available for everyone and I am talking to everyone be it office , family , friends and muskan 
- I feel like being quite and in my place and in my comfort , not silent in the bus with 100 strangers standing on my head. 
- I miss my own time and sitting with myself. 
- I don't know how to find this time , because I am not able to do my roadmap studies as well , I am not finding the time to study and upskill as well. 
- I feel like I am stuck in this loop. 
--- 
- I wake early → physical & emotional energy used in martial arts + time with you 
- Immediately after → long commute → mental fatigue
- Office hours → social + cognitive load
- Commute back → drains remaining mental energy
- Time with Muskan → beautiful but still emotional presence required
- Family time → again presence required
- Day ends → no alone, no decompression, no silence
