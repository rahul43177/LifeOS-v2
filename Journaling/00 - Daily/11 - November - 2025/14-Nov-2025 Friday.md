## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 09:09 am #alive
- Just came from the Martial Arts class. 
- Then me and Muskan went for a short scooty ride where even we did not know where to go. I just took any road I felt like and then we reached to a lake out of the blue which we never saw before and we took a short ride in the lake. 
- And then we roamed around and we did fufu and then came home happy happy , feeling good.

###### 10:26 am #peace
- It was over a good day , I went to mandir where I got chills in the Arti 
- It was good vibe in the mandir , very peaceful 
- then I went to meet the Muskan , that was also good -- we talked deep stuff and the Persue teaching wala plan is dropped as master also told not to go ahead with it. 
- Overall a good day , a very peaceful day , I slept in the afternoon as well. 
- I felt irritated after waking up and had a little arguement with mom but we sorted it out.
