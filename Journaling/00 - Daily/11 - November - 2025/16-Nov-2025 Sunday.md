## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 11:24 am #calm #light
- Just came from the YOGA class
- My body and mind feels so light 
- But at the same time I feel so sleepy as well , I slept during the class.
###### 02:04 pm #irritated
- I am feeling really really irritated right now , I am still processing the emotions , I don't understand what is happening to me 
- Is it normal to feel irritated when you are always on a tight schedule and your girlfriend is always doubting you , if I am home alone , she will think someone will come to my home or something like that , and checking by video calling me and confirming it 
- In this situation is it normal to feel irritated or not !! I am feeling really really irritated and also I am falling behind in course and not able to dedicate the hours which I should be giving. 
- Today in the class , I was very sleepy and at some point of time I slept in the class and missed it. 
- This is very frustrating , I want to spend more time studying but how !! I don't have time. ̆
###### 02:25 pm #confused 
- Right now my mom and dad went for shopping as my brother's birthday is coming -- and I am thinking what should I give to him ans this is really confusing. 

###### 11:49 pm #motivated 
- I went to the Grand Master Acharya T Raghu home -- We went for the shooting of Master's Documentary -- because he wants to inspire the youth.
- I heard everything and it was such a touching and unbelievable story , how tough he is. 
- He is tough unimaginably. 
- He did one of the hardest trek , which people does in 7 days , He did it in 15 hours where 2 hours went waste because his partners went missing and there was some problem with the forest guards as well. 
- Overall -- I felt a really really good inspiration , if he can do it when he was 63 years old in his mid 60s , Then why can't I do half of it. 

###### Overall #nice #alive #satisfied 
- It was such a nice day and at the end , I spend the time at master's home , it was nice 
- I spent the later time with Muski , which was also nice and it was such a wonderful experience and talks and chess.
