## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 4:07 pm #relax #productive 
- completed the time zone and date format change on UAT
- Which feels really good because it feels like closing a loop 
- It was pending from sometime but closing that task has made me reclaim my energy 
- I didn’t go to office as well as I am planning to apply the leave i took on Tuesday 
- One more task is there which is taking some of my headspace is — Material Profile one.
- That is also pending from quite a time 
- I will sit with the codebase and close this loop as well. Because that made me feel really relieved and good. 
###### 04:51 pm #calm
- I did not go to office and rather came back to my area and decided to spend the time together with Muskan , so here we are in the new bel road in the CCD (Cafe coffee day). 
- So as soon as the timezone and date format changes I did and raised the PR for UAT , I left from bhaiya's place to spend the rest of the day with Muskan. 

###### 07:42 pm #chill 
- Right now we are just sitting and chilling and talking and we played chess as well. 
- Spent together time nicely.

###### 09:34 pm #hurt #nice 
- Muskan started checking my phone around 8:40 or something , and then he first checked my laptop , she was not searching anything in particular but she was investigating every bookmark , every social media site , twitch streaming platform and everything 
- I know this is part of the process of healing and trusting each other again. 
- But during this time when she checks my phone and laptop , I feel so bad I don't know why , 
- She does it and it could be due to  :
	- She is not feeling good about me and wants to confirm. 
	- This is her assurance -- ki haan sab kuch thik hai types 
- But for me it feels like : 
	- Itna shaq kyu karna hai 
	- It feels like disrespect for me. 
	- It feels like , if you check a person like if he has stolen something but he is not the thief , so that person will feel really bad and it would hurt him. 
- But I understand her perspective as well , so nevermind.
- Haan mera thoda muh ban jata hai ki kya jarurat hai is sab ki , itna bhi trust nahi hai toh kya hi hai fir and all 
- But she is right in her own place , wow ye mujhe abhi likhte likhte strike hua. 
- And jo mujhe bura feel ho raha tha vo chala gaya, now I understand her feeling more because I am trying to live those emotions from her perspective. 
- Ye shaq nahi hai , ye shayad uska assurance hai ki kuch galat toh nahi hai na , and but yeah it hurts me bad , but this is part of the process. 
- And muh banane ki jagah mujhe usko isme support karna chahiye. 
- Chalo now I feel nice. 

###### 09:45 pm #proud 
- Raunak (Gaurav - My brother) , there was one global hackathon where his team got into top 5 
- There were total of 3000 teams , and usme top 5 me ayi hai inki team 
- So they got selected for the next round which will happen for top teams.
- That is going to happen in Odisha , so Raunak is going with his team.
- All travel , stay and food expense , college wale hi denge. 
- It is like a tournament where you code and participate and Odisha ghumne bhi miljayega. 
- Abhi recently toh ek 2nd runner ban ke hi aye the jisme 20k jite the , toh vo divide by 4 hua toh udhar 5k mila abhi recently 
- Kal hi ek quiz competition tha college me udhar bhi jeeta toh 1k mila prize money. 
- So isliye hi vo ate hi mom dad ko bataya aur bola mujhe khilane pilane leke chalo ab , mai naam raushan kar raha hu and then they went to Budha Cafe and then GKVK food street. 
- Feeling proud that he is doing really really good. Jiyo sher

## What might be behind this feeling?
(Any event, thought, or situation that could be connected? It’s okay if you’re not sure.)
##### Possible reason(s): 
1. Tense 
	- Tension for us , ki kitna trust level down hai ham dono ke bich
2. Hopeful
	- Right now I tried to debug why she does what she does , when checking my phone 
	- And I understood her situation and emotions whatever she feels . even I feel that , I also love assurance which gives me so much peace. 
3. Loving 
	- Because I know she loves me a lot and she cares a lot for me. 
	- Mujhe apni jaan ke liye bura bhi lagta hai ki mere wajah se kitna jheli hai jaan 
	- Aur still she is sticking to it , she does not have any reason to stick with me. 
		- Na mai uske spiritual level pe hu , bohot niche hu in fact 
		- Na mai uske jitna good looking and good personality hu 
		- Na hi maine utna achieve kiya hai jitna uske har field me kardiya hai - dance , sports , NCC , dance fest , battles , underground hip hop , job , fitness instructor , 2-3 ghante meditate karlena , bhai damn 
	- Still she is sticking with me , pyaar karti hai yaar dil se mujhse 
	- Kitna hurt kiya maine tab bhi hai mere sath , toh I feel the love she brings to the table ,
		- She had a little rough time at home while growing up because of father and all , jidhar pyaar naam ki chiz hi nahi hai 
		- mom ne maarne ki koshish ki because she does not want another child to be raised in this environment , mai unki duvidha bhi samajh raha hu , kitni lachaar hongi aunty 
		- Papa ka drama , ghar ka drama , apas me maa baap ki ladai , hath uthana
		- dono pairo me injury -- 2 surgeries 
		- mera drama vo sab. 
		- Jo bachpan ke dost the , vo faltu bolne lag gaye , chori ka ilzaam lagane lag gaye 
		- ghar pe taane , didi se taane 
	- Agar is sab se nikal ke mujhe itna pyaar dena , har mumkin koshish karna mujhe pyara feel karane ke liye , mujhe hasane ke liye.
	- Mere bare me sochna , aur analyse karna , decide karna kya nahi hai iske paas , konse color ke kapde nahi hai , aur fir dhund dhund ke research karke mujhe ek ek karne diya 
	- Mere liye Himalayas ka experience chord ke ayi kyunki mera bday tha and she wanted to be part of it and wanted to be with me. 
	- Aise na jane kitne chize jo vo roz karti hai , itna micro level tak soch leti hai ki isko pulpy orange pasand hai toh leleti hu , iske liye paani leleti hu 
	- And it goes till macro 
	- She loves to be with me , she loves to buy time with me , she tries squeeze every second of time whatever she can to be with me. 
	- Aur is sab ke baad mai uska poke kardeta hu kabhi kabhi , usko disrespect kardeta hu , ulta sidha bolta hu 
	  **KYU ?**
	- because she checked my phone ? 
		- Rahul please grow up mere bhai 
		- Is se zyada samjhdaar , aur pyaar karne wali ladki nahi hai aaj ki duniya me 
		- usne bohot kuch jhela hai , sab jhelte hue , nikal ke aa rahi hai ek dam datt ke samna ki hai vo , bandi mentally bohot strong hai -- bohot jhel liya hai life me and physically bhi -- Himalayas chhad ke ayi hai 19k feet pe , aur tujhe pyaar kar rahi hai , aise behave mat kiya kar , nahi milne wala aisa koi insaan jo itna unconditional love karega 
		- Tu hi bol raha tha na ki "Muskan tera pyaar conditional hai" -- ghanta mere bhai , isko bolte hai shiddhat se pyaar karna 
		- She is on a boat jidhar , lehre bhi opposite me ja rahi hai with full force , wind bhi opposite direction me ja rahi hai with full force and barish bhi bohot tez hai -- is sab ko chirte hue vo bina tute , bina dag magaye 
		- Bohot pyari bandi hai , izzat se rakhna usko zindagi bhar , sanjhoh ke.
