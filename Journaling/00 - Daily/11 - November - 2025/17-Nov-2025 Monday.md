## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 11:43 am #rested #light #positivity 
- I could not go to the class + office today , as I was not able to wake up. 
- But one good thing is I slept really nicely -- I slept for 9 hours after so long. 
- So today I feel so refreshed and deeply rested after so long , So I am planning to go to bed at 10:30 pm everyday so that I get adequate sleep. 
- But the problem is I have to complete 3 days in the office for this week. 
###### 12:22 pm  #hope #positivity 
- So I created a weekly analysis of my reports and I don't know why -- the report is not good but it is still like a mirror showing me things bluntly and I am feeling good about it. 
- The thing is -- These weekly reports are making me more calm and making me understand myself better -- which is good and which was the whole point of doing this practice. 
- To understand my emotions better and to know myself better -- that what am I feeling and why I am feeling something. 
- So I think I am gonna stick to this practice of just coming here , put a timestamp and dump whatever I am feeling in the entire day at any time I am feeling and at the end of day somewhere I just fill the rest of the section. 
- wake up -> fill the sleep wala sections -> entire day timestamp wala feeling dump -> at the end of the day -> fill rest of the sections. 

###### 03:37 pm #chill
- So right now I feel really really chill , and I am in no mood to work , which is I am not taking it in a bad way , I kind of like this chill mood today , no rush , no deadline , no one to report to 
- Nothing to worry about. 
- There are few tasks which are going come in near future and I have gotten the heads up about it as well. But today at present in the moment -- I am chill. 
- I am Relaxed and nothing to worry about

###### 04:34 pm #excited 
- I learnt how to use the flashcards and spaced repetition in the obsidian to make my learning more effective 
- And that gave me a high and dopamine hit and made me excited to learn new things and then review them with a proper system , and if I find something easy I will put it in easy and review in more days , and if something is difficult and hard -- I will have to review it in a day or two. 
- Which in my opinion is really great . but one thing is bugging me -- the syntax , the syntax of the spaced repetition -- makes my notes look ugly. This bugged a bit , but i guess it bringing far more value that making my notes ugly haha . 

###### 05:25 PM #excited 
- Right now , I came for a haircut and I pulled Muskan also in it .
- Even tho she finds it boring , but I asked her to come 
- So right now I am waiting for her 
- And then we will leave for haircut — excited little bit for the changed look and lets see how it goes .

###### 09:13 pm
- So went for haircut , haircut is done and the hair seems good enough.
- Spent the entire evening with Muski , it was fun . We played chess together and I wont both the games yuhhhuuu. 
- It was a good evening and nice day. Felt really good throughout.

###### 11:28 pm
- Feeling good and nice.
