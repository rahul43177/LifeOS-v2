## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 11:43 am #rested #light #positivity 
- I could not go to the class + office today , as I was not able to wake up. 
- But one good thing is I slept really nicely -- I slept for 9 hours after so long. 
- So today I feel so refreshed and deeply rested after so long , So I am planning to go to bed at 10:30 pm everyday so that I get adequate sleep. 
- But the problem is I have to complete 3 days in the office for this week. 
###### 12:22 pm  #hope #positivity 
- So I created a weekly analysis of my reports and I don't know why -- the report is not good but it is still like a mirror showing me things bluntly and I am feeling good about it. 
- The thing is -- These weekly reports are making me more calm and making me understand myself better -- which is good and which was the whole point of doing this practice. 
- To understand my emotions better and to know myself better -- that what am I feeling and why I am feeling something. 
- So I think I am gonna stick to this practice of just coming here , put a timestamp and dump whatever I am feeling in the entire day at any time I am feeling and at the end of day somewhere I just fill the rest of the section. 
- wake up -> fill the sleep wala sections -> entire day timestamp wala feeling dump -> at the end of the day -> fill rest of the sections.
