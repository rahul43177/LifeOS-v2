## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 

###### 2:05 pm 
- It's raining heavily and I feel really really irritated and she is not listening at all 
- abhi cab se vo aa rahi hai and then we will go but why am I irritated ? 
- Is this because I have so much work and I am not in the mood to go to the place as I will not be present there and my whole mind will be distracted 
- We will be spending money as well , and my entire brain will be in the work and the problem and the issue. 
- I will also not be productive there in the hotel room , compared to my desk at home. 
- I think this is the reason I feel really really irritated and Muskan is not considering it , chalte hai chalte. 
- I have little anger also for her and I still remember the words she told me , it was bad. It is like a bad memory which reminds me of her words and then I don't feel good about it
