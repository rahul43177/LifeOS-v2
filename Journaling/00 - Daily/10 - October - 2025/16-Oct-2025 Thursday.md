## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 11:39 am #excited 
- Today Chaitanya is on leave , let's reach office ,I am gonna clog 4 hours and leave for home and meet muski yuuhhuuu 
---
###### 12:02 am #angry 
- Muskan asked me she dreamt about me talking to tannu giri in school 
- Which I have no connection with 
- I don’t even know her
- So i denied Muskan that it is not true what you saw in your dreams
- So she started getting furious , her words : 
	- If you deny my all the things I am not gonna be with you 
	- Achhe logo ke sath raha kar 
	- Mai nahi rahungi tere sath if you keep on denying stuff 
- So now what am I supposed to do ? Should I agree even tho that is not true 
- It’s really stressful for me not because that is true but because that is not true and she thinks I deny everything 
- Really takes the toll on my mood

---
###### 1:01 pm #sad 
- I am not feeling good 
- I feel very sad with these kind of questions first of all , weather you were talking to someone else that time or this time 
- Chalo that is also fine because she has trust issues , and the root cause is me , but then If you are asking a question of yes and no. 
- If I say no , it should be accepted , what is the point of saying : 
	- If you keep on denying my stuff, i will not stay with you 
	- Please be with good people (Achhe logo ke sath raho )
- How are these statements relevant and why do you have to say these things to me ? 
- I felt really bad.

###### 2:55 pm  #upset #moodoff
- My mood is very upset and my mood is off , because me doing anything , like anything she is acting so cold. 
- Calling me but not talking anything 
- She declined my video calls also 
- What is the root cause of this behaviour , what did I do to be acted upon like this ? 
- I am feeling really low and sad right now.
- One reason could be , she got her periods and she is having mood swings and having a hard time. 
- Overall it is really sad.

###### 3:36 pm #questioning 
- Is it really common that being so attached to your partner , if they don't talk properly you get so affected and it affects your energy level and mood so bad , that you are sad and still. 
- And if the things get sort out , it is all fine and you are happy like a kid. 
- This is what happens with me. I am affected by even the smallest thing

###### 10:20 pm #anxiety
- Right now I am in class 
- I don't know why there is some tension between me and Muskan , she thinks I am lying and hiding something 
- But what is the point of lying to her and why would I do it. 
- The feeling which I hate the most is lying and hiding the stuff , which I got an idea recently when I did not tell my parents about the accident. 
- The constant fear of being caught , What if they get to know ? what will happen and bla bla ? 
- This feeling is really really bad and I don't like it.
- So I am really being honest with her but when she asks me question and if she only feels ki mai jhoot bol raha hu hurts me a lot. 
- And that gives me anxiety as well , ki what if she really believes that I am lying , even though I am not. 
- This is not good.

(Any event, thought, or situation that could be connected? It’s okay if you’re not sure.)

###### Possible reason(s): 
-  The reason behind me feeling anxious is , Muskan feels that I am lying even though I am not 
- So I am feeling little anxious what if she believes that is true and yeah I am lying which is not true 
- And so that she does not feel in this way , I start to deny it in very hard manner , which seems fake to her 
- And then I don't like this.
