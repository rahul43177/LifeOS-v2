## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 

###### 11:00 am #joy #relax #hope 
- So today my phone was on silent , I missed my Sailum MMA class which was in morning 6 am to 7 am 
- But mom woke me up around 7:15 am saying , class nahi hai 
- I was like shit , but then I still had one more class which was "YOGA" 
- So it was my first YOGA class which was taken by Grand Master 
- I attended it , It was mainly a theory class , and the type of YOGA taught by sir is : Vajra YOGA
- It was theory focused class and sir told how to do pranam in it 
- It was a very relieving session , I felt really really good. 
- And I asked the question as well , can It be used in day-to-day life , as managing my stress levels ? ,  will it help me with my mental health and everything , which sir replied as YES.
- Post our class Me and Muskan went to GKVK and then sat there for sometime and spent time , which was really really good , because she was also very very happy and feeling the joy. 


###### 4:30 #irritated 
- There is some anger I have for Muskan , Because of how she has made me feel because of the things she assumed or felt which are real. But from my perspective those things are not real and I feel hurt if you assume yourself that I have done some bad parts and start to abuse me , that is not good. 
	- First thing i have anger build up on her , as soon as I see her I doubt my choice of partner right now , because how she makes me feel. 
	- She does not acknowledge it , by saying , once It is proved that I am wrong or I was doubting you for no reason , I will apologise to you , till then what I supposed to be ? Like this feeling small ? With constant abuses ? I don't like it 
- And the fact these calls and love is day basis , if she is having a good day , she will constantly call me frequently within small durations. 
- If she is not having a good day or assumed something about me (which is not true) , she will not even pick my call or return my call. 
- I was very irritated with the frequent calling and calling again and again from Muskan and I was gaming as well. 
- And as soon I picked her phone , she was sleeping before that , she started telling : You did not text me or call me when I was sleeping , you did not miss me at all and bla bla. 
- And I got really pissed and I told her , don't you have any other work , or don't you have any life.
- Every waking hour you have to call me , text me , call me to meet and I got very smothered with it. 
- And once I told it , She got really mad , she did not pick my phone call. 
- I have almost called her for 21 outgoing normal calls + 4/5 Whatsapp calls as well ,  which she canceled or did not pick. 
- She did not answer the calls and then It was Diwali , although I just expressed what I felt , I said sorry to her.
- From deep down I don't want her to go away from me , it is just sometimes I felt that time  when I feel to be alone and not to be disturbed again and again , and calls for no reason. 

###### 8:30 pm  #upset #moodoff
- The Diwali Pooja is almost completed . 
- I am calling her constantly to get ready we will meet after the Pooja and she is either not picking up , if she is picking up she is constantly telling "Mujhe nahi milna" , "Kyu milu mai" 
- I said sorry as well , I said please please please , still nothing 
- And this kept on going till 10 pm 
- In the duration of 1 and half hour I called her again and again in short durations , if she changes her mind , we can meet. 
- But she kept on denying it and she does not want to see me. 
- I wanted to burst some crackers with her , I wanted to show my Kurta to her. I was little bit excited as this day only comes 1 day per year. So even said that let's keep our egos aside and let's meet , we can fight about it or discuss it later. 
- But no 
- And then I finally gave up and came home 10:45 pm 

This was Diwali 2025 
We (Anshul , Ayush and Me + Muskan (If she would like to join)) will have a great diwali next year . 
Anshul and Ayush are my best friends. 
- Anshul is my friend since 11th grade in school (2016)
- Ayush we both met him in college so since (2018) 
###### Diwali Special 
- This year's Diwali was little off , There was not much of an excitement regarding Diwali
I think there are few reasons to it :-> 
- We don't have much friends to celebrate with now , only me + 2 
- So we did not have much to do , in big groups it is all fun and games , someone is screaming and bursting cracker , teasing each other and laugh.
- But I also feel the bigger the group , the bigger the politics and there are sub-groups in the big group. 
- So I like it with my current friends. 
- One highlight is , this is the biggest festival of Hindu dharma , and she denied of meeting me at all. So I really got my mood off and could not celebrate with full potential. 
- Next year , we will plan a Diwali Party.

This is it for the day.

## What is my mind saying?
(Write the thoughts that are repeating — even small ones.)

- Mind is asking me questions , weather this partner is correct for me or not.

- This swing is taking toll on my mental health and the moods 
- I am doubting weather she will be a good choice or not. That's it.

## Reflection of the day
(If you have time or feel like writing more.)

==What helped me feel slightly better today?==
- Naam jap 
- Playing game 
- Yoga class (obviously)

==One thing I'm grateful for:==
- For my body 
- For the money we have that we can celebrate and buy the crackers.
- I saw some kids from my balcony on the other house , just watching other people bursting crackers . because they don't have funds for it or something like that . 
- So I am grateful for having such condition that we can celebrate however we want.
