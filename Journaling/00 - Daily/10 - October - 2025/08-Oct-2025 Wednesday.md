###### 4:37 pm  #scared #anxiety #family #lying 
- I am so scared and have anxiety about my bike , they are all over me on this , and the service centre is not responding properly , they are not giving me the bike and they are not making it ready 
- Bas jhila rahe hai baitha ke kal lelo aaj lelo 
- Raghav chutiya jhoot boldiya , aur ab phone switch off karke baitha hai 
- Ghar wale bol rahe hai leke aja , roz isme hi discuss hota rehta hai bike ka kya hua , bike ka kya hua , bhai chill karo yaar 
- Ab meri fatt rahi hai kyunki abhi ye log yelahanka hi ja rahe hai shopping karne , aur kahi mere papa pahunch na jaye unko sunane , ki kya chal raha hai de kyu nahi rahe 
- Mujhe ye situation achhi hi nahi lag rahi hai , itna jhoot bolna pad raha hai mujhe , mujhe nahi bolna jhoot , ye andar se itna bura lagta hai jhoot bolke and upar se dil me alag hi bechaini hoti hai aur darr rehta hai 
- Mujhe bolna hi nahi hai , but gharwale itne chill kaha , agli baar se gaadi nikalne me 4 baar sunayenge mujhe 
- upar se agar pata chal gaya ki 30k lag rahe hai toh meri afat ajayegi. 
- Mujhe ye situation bilkul bhi achi nahi lag rahi hai , jaldi se ye bike ajaye aur fir sab sahi hojayega , mujhko accha nahi lag raha.
- Roz baithne me bhi yahi darr rehta hai ki bike ka puchh lenge aur in log ko bhi chain nahi hai , wahi bike bike bike bike , kya hua bike ka , bike ka kya hua , bike kab layega , arey bhai jab denge le aunga , mujhe zyada tension hai bike ap logo se. 
- Ab mai kya karu , surrender kar deta hu 
- Surrender kar raaha hu bhagwan par , dekhte hai. Kaash kuch ho na aur ye log ghum ghaam ke aise hi ajaye bina showroom jaye.
- I am really really scared and I feel really heavy and this is taking all of my headspace. 
- I am not able to focus on anything , i am just thinking about this.

###### 5:03 pm #chill #background 
- my feelings are little less intense than before when they were leaving 
- I hope , they don’t act out of the energy and go to the service center
- one thing is , they have never visited the service center so they will be little bit hesitant because they will have to find out the check the maps and all 
- and mostly the closing time is a gift for me if they don't get free early
- baki ab dekhte hai it should be fine i guess
- I am gonna play some counter strike because baithe baithe sochne ke alawa what else can I do , so rather I will play counter strike  , jo hoga dekha jayega 
- Radha radha radha

- She is not feeling good , she doesn't want to come back , and asking things like - Did I try to reach out to chaitra or not !!! 
- It was not even a question like that , more of - you reached out to chaitra . I have left all that , mujhe nahi baat karni hai kisi se. 
- She is in so much pain , I want to help her somehow , mai bas apni baato se hi kar sakta hu , vo bhi ache se nahi ho paa rahi because there are so many people around and texting itne pain mai karna mushkil hai :( 
- Abhi mujhe kal ki chinta ho rahi hai , 
	- Pehli baat kal bhi aise hi ghuma denge ya bike denge 
	- And dusri , denge toh office se nikal ke lana and manage karna hoga 
- Just now i read some reviews about that service center 
- All the bad reviews are there and it feels mere parts and all na badal diye ho
