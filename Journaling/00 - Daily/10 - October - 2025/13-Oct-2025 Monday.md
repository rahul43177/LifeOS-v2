## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 11:24 am #alive #relax 
- I went for the first Sailum MMA class today
- It was so nice to feel it again the way I felt it in the Agra taekwondo class 
- This feeling is something which I felt after so so long 
- After almost 13 years I felt this feeling again , that thrill and that kick. 
- I think I am gonna stick to this and gonna practice it daily. 
- And I feel really hopeful and happy right now because of : 
	- It is gonna make my body happy
	- It will give a sense of doing and learning something and trying something new , which would make me more alive
	- I think this will be reason to quit cigg 
	- And my sleep cycle would be fine because the class will happen at 6 am in the morning 
- So i think it is all a win win.

## What is my mind saying?
(Write the thoughts that are repeating — even small ones.)
- Right now mind is asking why did data team did not find any duplicates , and what should be my action plan for tomorrow - it is related work. Nothing serious just little confused because I got duplicates when I called API. 
- Whereas they are informing that they did not get any duplicates in the record and query. 
- One thing is the above one and the second thing is how to manage my studies as I am not able to watch and attend the classes and already the pile up has started for the classes and learnings. 
- Need to work little bit on it.
