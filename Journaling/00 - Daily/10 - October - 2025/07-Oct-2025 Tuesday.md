## How do I feel right now?
- Emotion(s): low , tense and anxious
- Energy level (1–10):  6.5 (I am very sleepy )

## What might be behind this feeling?
Possible reason(s):
- Because my family is all over on me that ki bike leke aja aur mujhe bas darr hai ki ye impatient hoke bike lene na chale jaye 
- Agar aisa hua toh fir unhe pata lag jayega
- Ab usko leg gaurd tut gaya hai toh mujhe kal bike ghar lane se pehle leg gaurd bhi lagana hai toh uski bhi chinta ho rahi hai 
- Aur fir Amit ki itni personal baatien sun ke mujhe bura laga
- Uski ankho me aur uski baaton me vo ladki ke liye pyaar bohot visible tha
- Uske papa ko miss karta hu vo , pehli Diwali papa ke bina
- Mujhe uske bare me sochke acha nahi laga but bohot strong hai vo
