## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 5:30 am #alive #hope 
- I woke up and then went for the MMA class , I liked it , it was all good and did some kicks on kicking pad 
- I learnt inner crescent kick and outer crescent kick. 
- It was a very good feeling. 
###### 7:15 am #alive #sad 
- Then the class got over. 
- We are still not talking to each other. 
- I asked her let's go little bike ride after the class , here on the roads to make things alright and we will feel good about it. 
- But she did not respond properly and said : "Mujhe nahi jana" , then she was like petrol dalwana hai - "She filled the tank" , I went to petrol pump as well. 
- But while coming back , she turned to her home and the I also came to a chai shop alone.
- These kind of feelings is what a relationship should be ? 
- I have a note folder called : Letters I will never send. Where Muskan asked me once a while back when she was in good mood , "mujhe nahi batayega toh kisko batayega"  
- But yesterday I expressed that I am feeling smothered and then all this happened. 
###### 3:36 pm  #heavyHeart
- I even said sorry , which she clearly tells me ki "You don't mean it , why are you even telling it , Tere gharpe sab yahi karte hai udhar hi rakh ye , mere sath mat kar" , what is this ? 
- And then it lead to another argument , ki ye vo. 
<span style="background:#ff4d4f">Literal words from Muskan</span> : 
- Tu khud ko kya samjhta hai ? 
- Bohot bada artist ban gaya hai kya MMA join karke ? 
- Tere baap ki beti hu kya mai ?
- Mujhko mat bol kaise baat karna hai , tu khud ka dekh le

What is happening right now with me : 
- I am not liking it anymore with her , although she gives me love , but it is way more stressful than the comfort. 
- The relationship is supposed to be a comfortable home. 
- It should be not like earthquake ki jab marzi and jab mood kharab hua , it should not be storm in my mental health
- And then justifying it as , you used to text other girls so I deserve it. 
- Yes I used to , but I am changed now , it's been more than 1 year and I have not done anything bad. 
- But still these episodes are not good enough. I don't like it. And it is not good to generalise it. 
- These things at regular interval is drifting me away from her 
	- We used to be one north pole and one one ice slab
	- Initially there came some cracks on the Ice slab 
	- Then now it feels we both are in the different Ice slabs 
	- And slowly drifting away from each other
	- let's take some time and give 2-3 weeks of time and record all the patterns and everything and then I will take a technical + emotional decision. 
- Let's see. 

###### 10:15 pm #relieved #love #happy 
- I met with Muskan in the evening around 6:30 pm , and we did cafe hopping 
- It was so good and we talked and sorted things out and we laughed 
- I dressed up very nicely and wore formal and I wanted to surprise her. 
- It was nice we went to Cafe Rome. 
- We sorted things out and I told what I did not like and even she did express about the things she did not like.
- And then we came home. 
- We even watched Grand Master's videos where he knocked out Satish Sir (our current Martial Arts teacher.)
- It was a good day and we spent time together ache se baith ke baat kiye and it was such a great relief. 
- And I look forward to the tomorrow's Martial Arts class and I am so excited for it as well as we are going to learn the blocks.
