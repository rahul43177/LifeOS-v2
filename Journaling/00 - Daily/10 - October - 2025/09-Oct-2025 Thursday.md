## Anything in your mind just dump it and say it whenever you feel like in the entire day 
###### 9:15 am #anger 
- Just talked to Muski and I am not happy from her 
- I have anger for you and most of the time what feels wrong to me , tere liye kuch hua hi nahi hota
- Ramesh ko bhejna is such a normal thing
- tujhe pata chala ki mujhe bura lagega and that is why you told ki bura mat manna because tujhe ache se pata hai mujhe bura lagega. 
- And then maine kitna clearly bataya bhi jataya bhi ki kya zarurat hai 
- Still I asked kyu bhejna hai, uska bhi koi reason nahi koi ans nahi koi logic nahi hai boldiya , bas bhejna hai 
- Aur bhi kitna bola tune ki tera aise hi hoga hamara bohot deep level shit tha hamara and all and usko acha lagega toh mujhe acha lagega

Ab chize ye hai ki 
1. Maine clearly mana kiya tha
2. Even you knew ki mujhe bura lagega 
3. I started getting angry as well 
 
Itna sab jaanne ke baad bhi you prioritised what you want and mera pura ignore maardiya ki isko acha nahi lag raha hai aur acha nahi lagega and then playing the card itna toh tu jhel hi sakta hai and all 

Apne bare me socha na bas tune , fir mujhse bol rahi hai ki “mujhse expect nahi karega toh kis se karega”

Nahi karna bhai mujhe , you think all about yourself 
ab puch rahi ho something is off and all 
Haa obv there is , mujhe nahi acha lag raha 
And my solution to this is to expect less from you.
