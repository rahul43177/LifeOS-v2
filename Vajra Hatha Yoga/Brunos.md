Giordano Bruno (1548–1600)
**Italian philosopher, astronomer, and mystic of the Renaissance.**

##### Key Contributions

He proposed ideas far ahead of his time, such as:

- The universe is infinite
- Stars are other suns with their own planets
- Life may exist beyond Earth
- God is not separate but present in all of reality (pantheism)

These ideas directly challenged:

- The Catholic Church’s view that Earth is the center of everything
- The idea of a finite, closed universe

##### Conflict and Death

Bruno was not killed because of astronomy alone.
The Church executed him mainly due to theological beliefs, such as:

- God and the universe being the same (Pantheism)
- Denial of core Catholic doctrines

He was burned alive at the stake in Rome.

Legacy: Free thought, scientific imagination, and the idea of an infinite universe.
