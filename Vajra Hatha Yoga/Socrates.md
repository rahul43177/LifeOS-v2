Socrates (469–399 BCE)
**Greek philosopher, considered the father of Western philosophy.**

##### Core Ideas & Method
Socrates didn’t write anything himself. We know him mostly through his student Plato.
His main method was the:
##### Socratic Method
A style of questioning that exposes contradictions in someone’s belief, forcing them to think deeply.
**Simple Example:**
>“What is courage?”
>“Is courage the same in war and in arguing for truth?”
>“If you can’t answer consistently, do you actually understand courage?”
He believed:
- The unexamined life is not worth living
- Wisdom begins by realizing you know nothing
- `Ethics > wealth`  ,  power, reputation

##### Death
He was sentenced to death for:
- "Corrupting the youth"
- "Not believing in the city’s gods"
He calmly accepted death by drinking hemlock poison — choosing principle over life.

Legacy: Rational thought, ethics, foundation of philosophical reasoning.
