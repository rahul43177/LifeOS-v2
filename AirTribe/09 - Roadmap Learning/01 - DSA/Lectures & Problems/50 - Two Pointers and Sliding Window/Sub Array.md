Contiguous part of an array -> Meaning a slice of elements that occupy consecutive positions. 

`arr = [1,2,3,4,5]`
so here -> continuous part -> `[2.3]` -> this is sub array of `arr`

### Key characteristics
- **Contiguous** - The elements must appear one after another in the original array.
- **Maintain order** - The relative order of the elements is preserved.
