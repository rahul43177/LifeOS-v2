[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/)

### Description in my words : 
- One array is given -> `nums`
- Where there are `n` distinct numbers are there in the array 
- These distinct numbers are in the range of -> `[0 , n]`
- We need to find which number is missing in it. 

Example : 
Input : `nums  = [3,0,1]`
- So the length of the array is -> 3 -> which is `n`
- So here `n = 3`
- So the numbers can be from the range -> `[0 to 3]` -> `[0,1,2,3]`
- All the numbers of `nums` are *unique*.
