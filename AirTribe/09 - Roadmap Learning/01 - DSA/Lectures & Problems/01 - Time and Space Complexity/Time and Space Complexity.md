## Time Complexity 
It is used to measure efficiency of algorithm in terms of speed , as the input size grows. \
***Time Complexity ≠  Time Taken***

##### We are taking two searching algorithms
- Linear Search 
- Binary Search

###### Linear Search
![[../../../../../attachments/Time and Space Complexity - linear search.png]]
- We are simply looping and checking one by one 
- If we find the array and returning the index. 
- Done

###### Binary Search
![[../../../../../attachments/Time and Space Complexity - binary search.png]]
- Binary search works like - It works on the sorted array only - it breaks down the array into two parts 
-   We break down the array into two parts and then we check weather 10 (The target we are searching) is on the left side or the right side. 
![[../../../../../attachments/Time and Space Complexity - binary search 2.png]]
- So here we can see that the 10 is present on the right side of the array. 
- NOTE : This will work only in the sorted array. 
- Now the new array is ![[../../../../../attachments/Time and Space Complexity- new array.png]]
- Then again we will divide this array into 2 parts and then 10 is at the middle and we found the element. 
- So only in two steps we found the 10. So this is fast searching algor
So here in the every next step we are dividing the array into
