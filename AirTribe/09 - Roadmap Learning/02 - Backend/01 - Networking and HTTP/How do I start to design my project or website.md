## Project Ideation 
First and foremost thing is to think about : 
1. What exactly do I want from this project ? 
2. How will a website help me achieve that ? 
3. What needs to be done and in what order ?

Thinking about these are the first step before starting a project.

## Deeper Dive 
A project will never be successful , if we don't plan about it beforehand.
We must know what are we trying to achieve and what is the order of execution of the things we have planned. 

Example if you are musician , if you don't have any idea in your mind : what kind of music do I want to play ? 
If you are not clear with this part , no matter how good of a musician you are , you will never be able to play.
Same is the case with painter , you can be the best painter in the world , but if in your mind you don't have any idea or clear picture of what you want to draw or paint, you will never be able to paint. 

So similarly for the developers , if you are not clear with the planning and structuring your ideas , you will not be able to develop a good website. 

## Before starting any project : 
1. Sit down with a pen and paper 
2. Write down our thoughts and the expectation from the projects 

**Ask yourself**
### What do I want to accomplish from this project ? 
Let's say I want to build a simple project called - Budget management
So what do I want to accomplish from this : 
1. To help people manage their finances properly 
2. To help people track their expenses 
3. To help people get more financial literacy 
4. To help people understand where their money is going
5. To help people cut down their expenses

--- 
Once the list is prepared we will order them by priority 
1. To help people track their expenses 
2. To help people understand where their money is going
3. To help people get more financial literacy 
4. To help people manage their finances properly 
5. To help people cut down their expenses

### How could a website bring me to my goals ? 
It will help me reach to more audience which would help more people about the financial literacy
