**Servers: The Powerhouses Behind Every Digital Experience**

Servers are computers optimised for providing services to other computers. While your personal laptop might have a fast processor for running games or editing videos, servers are built for different priorities: reliability, the ability to handle many simultaneous requests, and running continuously without interruption.

Web servers specifically handle HTTP requests from browsers and respond with web pages, images, videos, or data. But the server ecosystem is much richer than just web servers. You have database servers that store and manage data, application servers that run the business logic of web applications, file servers that store and share files, and many other specialized types.

When you're developing web applications, you'll often work with multiple types of servers. Your code might run on an application server, store data in a database server, and serve static files like images from a file server or content delivery network.
