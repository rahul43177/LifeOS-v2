### **What is backend development?**

Backend development refers to the server-side part of a web application, focusing on databases, server logic, and application programming interfaces (APIs). It handles data processing, business logic, authentication, and server configuration. While frontend development deals with what users see and interact with, backend development ensures the application functions properly behind the scenes.
