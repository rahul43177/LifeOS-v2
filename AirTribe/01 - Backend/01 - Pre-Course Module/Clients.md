**Clients: Your Window to the Digital World**

A client is any device that requests services or resources from other computers on the network. Your laptop running a web browser is a client, but so is your smartphone checking email, your smart TV streaming Netflix, or even your car's navigation system downloading traffic updates.

What makes something a client isn't the device itself, but its role in a particular interaction. The same computer can act as both a client and a server depending on what it's doing. For instance, your laptop acts as a client when you browse websites, but if you're running a local development server for testing your web applications, it's also acting as a server.

As a web developer, you'll primarily work with web browsers as clients. Browsers are sophisticated pieces of software that can interpret HTML, execute JavaScript, render CSS styles, and handle various media types. They also manage the complex process of sending requests to servers and processing the responses.
