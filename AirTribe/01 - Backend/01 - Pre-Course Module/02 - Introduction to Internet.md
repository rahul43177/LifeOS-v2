## What is internet ? 
Simply put : Internet is a global network of inter-connected computers that communicate with each other to share informations.

**Internet** -> Interconnected networks 
***The word "internet" actually comes from "interconnected networks" - it's literally a network that connects other networks together.***

#### At its core, the internet consists of three key components:

1. [[Clients]]  are the devices that users interact with to access the internet. This includes computers, smartphones, tablets, and other internet-enabled devices. When you open a web browser and type in a website address, your device acts as a client, sending requests to servers and receiving responses in return.

2. [[Servers]]: Servers are powerful computers that store, process, and deliver data to clients. They host websites, applications, databases, and other resources that clients request. When you visit a website, your client sends a request to the server hosting that site, and the server responds by sending back the requested data.

3. [[Networking Infrastructure]] The network infrastructure consists of the physical and virtual components that facilitate communication between clients and servers. This includes routers, switches, cables, and other networking equipment. The infrastructure ensures that data packets are efficiently routed from their source to their destination, traversing various networks along the way.
