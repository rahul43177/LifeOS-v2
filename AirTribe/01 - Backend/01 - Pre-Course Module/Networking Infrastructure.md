**Network Infrastructure: The Hidden Foundation**

The network infrastructure is perhaps the most complex component, yet it works so seamlessly that we rarely think about it. This infrastructure includes physical components like fiber optic cables running under oceans, cell towers, and data centers, as well as logical components like internet protocols and routing algorithms.

Routers are special computers whose job is to direct traffic across networks. They maintain tables of network addresses and determine the best path for data to travel from source to destination. This routing happens automatically and dynamically - if one path becomes congested or fails, routers can redirect traffic through alternative paths.

The infrastructure also includes the protocols that govern how data is formatted, transmitted, and received. The most fundamental of these is TCP/IP, which breaks data into packets, ensures they arrive at their destination, and reassembles them in the correct order.
