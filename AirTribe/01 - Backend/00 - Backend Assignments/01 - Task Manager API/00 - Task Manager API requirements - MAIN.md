### Brief

- In this guided project, you'll build a RESTful API for managing tasks using `Node.js,` `Express.js`, and in-memory data storage. 
- You'll implement : 
	- CRUD operations 
	- Error handling
	- Input validation  
	- Test the API using Postman or curl.
- By completing each step thoroughly, you’ll gain a solid understanding of building APIs with `Express.js`, enhancing your skills in ==error handling, validation, and filtering.==
- Remember, the goal is to ==create a functional, well-structured API==. 
- Focus on understanding the concepts and implementing them in your own way. 
- If you get stuck, try to break down the problem and solve it step by step. Good luck!
