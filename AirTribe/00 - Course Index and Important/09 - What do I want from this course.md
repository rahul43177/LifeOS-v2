##### Reason Behind Joining AirTribe
Right now I am a software engineer in a company called Impact Analytics with an experience of 1.5 years , but I don't come from a computer science background. 
I joined one cohort of 6 months called FunctionUp where I learnt : 
1. Backend development 
	- NodeJs 
	- ExpressJs 
	- MongoDB 
	- Redis 
	- AWS 
	- basics of DSA - Arrays and Strings 
2. I built projects 
	- URL Shortner 
	- Blogging post website 
But these were very basics , and I was able to crack an entry level job

But now I want to deep dive into the world of backend engineering and I want to be technical very strong and for that my basics should be really really strong and hence I have started to study right from the basics.
