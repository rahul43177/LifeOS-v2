Please check the claude.md file where the introduction about the mtp-frontend project is written.
One overview is also present. 
I need to work on this frontend codebase. 

Request from you is : 
1. Please go through the frontend project 
2. Check the entire flow of the project
3. I would like you to give me short flow guide of the project 
4. How to navigate to the code 
	1. I have some experience in backend so , basically whenever I need to check some codebase I simply check the route and from the route I go to the controller -> then to service layer and then to the database layer 
	2. So the flow is simple how to check the code for some API 
5. But in the case of frontend I am not able to do it , from the screen how to navigate and how to check the codebase and everything. 
6. Can you please help me in guiding about how to navigate to the codebase for some screen.

Let's say the screen name is : 
![[../../attachments/00 - Frontend Navigation - material profile UI example.png]]

So this UI , I know things like : 
1. There is a route above -> `product-profile`
2. There are few heading and then sub heading and then a table called details table 

Now I want to change something in this screen how what is the best way to navigate into the codebase.
So request from you is : 
1. Check claude.md file for the overview of the frontend project
2. Check the codebase yourself as well for better understanding 

And give me the things I have asked , thanks
