So I want to start running -- but the main problem which I face during runs or walk in elevated surgace is -- My calf muscle starts to get sore and then it becomes very difficult to run 
Can you please tell me about it -- 
1. Is this common , mostly it is my left calf which gets sore and it gets caught up and make it difficult to run.
2. How can I avoid it , what should I do to make it alright ? 
3. What is the best practice which can help me avoid it -- like little warm up

Additionally -- Please share some tips with me regarding running as a beginner 
1. How much should I target in first run and first few weeks ? 
2. What should be my end goal ? 
3. What do people try to achieve who runs a lot ? 
4. What are some benefits from running -- will it help me build abs ? 
5. What is the best app -- the phone I use is iPhone 13 -- so which app should I rely on for the distance covered and some insights etc. 
6. I don't want a dependency of a fitness watch or something like that , so running on phone will that be inaccurate ?
