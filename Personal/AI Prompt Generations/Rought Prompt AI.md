I have been trying to study DSA from last 2 years actually -- 
I have tried several courses : Starting from : 
1. GFG Self Paced Course 
2. Love babbar supreme 2.0 
3. Udemy DSA in JavaScript 
4. Striver A2Z sheet 
5. Right now -- Namaste DSA 

But after some point I lose the interest as I feel this teacher is not good enough because I am still not able to solve the problems 
If I have completed the array part -- and then I try the array problem , I still struggle -- which leads me to think like that this teacher is not good enough and I should consider someone else. 

One more thing is I don't have any CS background , I did a coding bootcamp and then I started the job , but the DSA part is still lacks somewhere in me. 

Question from you -- 
1. Is it normal and happens with other people as well ? 
2. Can you please check the internet and community and if this is normal 
3. How to overcome and be really good in DSA to pass the interviews 
4. Please help me in this situation to lock in
5. For people like me who are juggling here and there -- what is the resource for other people which proved correct for them. 

Need you guidance here , thanks
