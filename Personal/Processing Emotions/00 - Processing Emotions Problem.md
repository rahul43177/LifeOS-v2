### What is happening right now ?
So whenever something hurts me , my first reaction to that is I put it under the rug and I don't like to talk about it or think about it. 
If some incident or some fight with my loved ones hurt me , I usually try to ignore it and not to re-live it and not think about it , I totally try to ignore it so that I avoid how I felt that time.

And mostly I do it all the time , I just ignore it and let it go (Atleast this is what I feel , that I let go thinks , reality could be different) , 
- Then I don't talk about that incident or thing which hurted me that time or ever. 
- I will not try to bring that topic or incident up.
- Even if someone brings it up , i will try to change the topic as that makes me uncomfortable 

So now what is happening : 
- I feel sad really often , very very often and I am not sure what is the reason I am sad for. 
this could be the one of the reason , this is what i feel , i am not sure : Is this because I put so many things under the rug and did not visit them or handle them in myself  and now they are coming to the surface . amd I am not able to find it and pin point it and they are so many and I am not sure ? 

And people around me really knows themselves as when they are sad , they are able to tell -> why are they sad and what is affecting them and what are they feeling. 
Whereas in my case , I am not sure what is the reason for the way I am feeling and what am I feeling. 
This feeling of blankness,  where I am not feeling anything , i am not sad , i am not happy , i am not excited 

and most of the times yeah sad . I become sad and I get low on energy and my mood is off and I become uninterested , i become irritated (only sometimes)


- Now I don't understand , what should I do in this case ? 
- What am I doing wrong ? 
- How people around can tell what is the reason for their sadness and I am clueless ? 
- How to know my emotions better ? 
- How to know what i am feeling and why I am feeling in that way ? 
- Is this a common issue , or is it just me ?
