### 1. Sit with yourself with a pause
- Just sit for 10 mins with yourself mostly at night and feel -> what is the emotion which I felt the most today ? 
- Try to find out the trigger and the incident.  
### 2. Journal 
- No need to overthink about this 
- Just sit with yourself for 10 mins and let it flow 
- How did I feel today , what was the emotion , try to process it 
- Let it flow in the notes 
- Type everything , type it all out on the notes app 
- 
### 3. Safe Reflection 
When something hurts you next time — instead of ignoring it, try this:
- Say to yourself: “Okay, that hurt. What part of it hurt me?”
- Don’t justify or rationalize. Just notice.

You don’t need to talk to the other person yet — just start by being honest with _yourself._

### 4. Emotional Vocabulary building
This might sound small, but try to **learn the language of feelings**.
The more words you have for emotions, the easier it becomes to _understand and regulate_ them.

Instead of “I’m sad” → try “I feel disappointed / rejected / lonely / tired / guilty.”

Go one more layer down , rather than being vague and then try to find the incident related to it 

One layer down -> exact emotion -> memory related to that emotion or incident
