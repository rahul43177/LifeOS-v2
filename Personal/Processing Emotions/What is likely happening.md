So if we keep pushing clothes and that too cluttered clothes in a closet 
After a point of time it will fill up and if we don't organise it properly , it will be so messy and so full that after a point of time, we don't know what's in there , which cloth is in there.

And those cluttered and unorganised (thoughts I did not give attention) and unprocessed emotions -> Creates a general heaviness, sadness, or numbness because your system is carrying all of this unresolved material.


So the thing basically happening here is : 
> “**If I just don’t think about it, I won’t feel hurt again.**”

so this has become my <font color="#9bbb59">Defence Mechanism</font> - This is basically - <font color="#c0504d">Emotional avoidance</font>

This is how my brain is trying to protect me , by not letting me think about the bad stuff which has hurt me , but in the long run my closet is getting messy and I am feeling numb and sad. 

When you say:

> “I feel sad very often, but I can’t tell why.”

It’s likely because many **unprocessed feelings are mixing together** — guilt, disappointment, fear, anger, loneliness — all tangled.  
Your system is saying, “Hey, we need to unload this.”  
But since your mind is not used to looking inward emotionally, it feels like _vague sadness_ or _blankness_.
