1. Alarm hits , leave the bed within 5 seconds 
2. Don't let the brain negotiate that snooze 
3. Discipline - Do things everyday no matter you are feeling it or not , either you are sick or not !
4. Start the morning with one hard thing - Don't resist - Like Cold shower or intense workout 
5. Over the time , we are doing our mornings , instead 
> We are the morning 
6. We are not building discipline , we should be discipline.
