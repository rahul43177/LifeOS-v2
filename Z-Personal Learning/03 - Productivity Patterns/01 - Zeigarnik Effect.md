We remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones. 
So there was one experiment done by Zeigarnik in a restaurant 
The observation was : 
> Waiters were able to remember the unpaid order better than the paid ones. 

The takeaways -> 
>  Close the loop  and reclaim the energy. 

##### What is the meaning of Loop here ? 
Any unfinished task, unresolved issue, or unmade decision that is taking up space in your mind.

##### Why should we close the loop
We should : 
- Enjoy the life instead of worrying 
- Be more present in conversations 
- Work harder 
- Be Happier
- Build confidence

##### What modern science says ? 
> Bad news is better than no news 

So people we asked about two things - Either you take 
1. Strong shock now ? 
	![[../../attachments/00 - Zeigarnik Effect - strong shock.png]]
2. A mild shock later ? 
	![[../../attachments/00 - Zeigarnik Effect - later shock.png]]

> 70% of the people wanted the strong shock right now 
###### The reason ? 
The prolonged uncertainty  hurt more than the medium discomfort. 


## Closing Loops
![[../../attachments/00 - Zeigarnik Effect - closing loops.png]]

1. Admit you have open loops 
2. Write them all down on a piece of paper / notes 
3. Pick one (the scariest)
4. Be specific , not fuzzy
5. Do it now or schedule it 
6. Repeat 


Close the loop => That will give strength to tackle a new loop or unfinished task and **reclaim the energy** through it
